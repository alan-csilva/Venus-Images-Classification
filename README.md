The objective is to classify Venus images about the presence of volcanoes using Machine Learning.

Models used were: Naive Bayes, LDA, QDA, KNN, Decision Tree Classifier, SVM (Linear, Polynomial, RBF)  
All hyperparameters were optimized through GridSearchCV.  
Primary metrics used to evaluate the models were Accuracy and F1 score.  
Maximum accuracy achieved was 93,12%.
